//! The L1-derivation catch-up runtime.
//!
//! Drives trustless sync. Walks L1 block ranges with [`arb_reth_l1::sync::derive_range`]
//! (SequencerInbox batches + delayed inbox + blob sidecars), and pushes each derived
//! [`BroadcastFeedMessage`] into the same feed channel the `ArbEngineDriver` drains, so
//! derived blocks execute through the same path the driver uses. It follows the L1 head
//! once caught up.
//!
//! ## Resuming
//!
//! `start_block` / `start_delayed_count` are the L1 block and `delayedMessagesRead` the resume
//! point was built from, and `start_l2_block` is the L2 block that point sits after. As the runtime
//! consumes each L1 window it records an [`L1ResumeCheckpoint`](crate::resume), once the window's
//! blocks are durable, so a later restart resumes from the last checkpoint instead of Nitro
//! genesis. On a resume whose checkpoint predates the durable tip (persistence outran the last
//! written checkpoint), the first re-derived blocks reproduce ones already on disk; they are
//! numbered absolutely from `start_l2_block` and dropped up to `db_tip_l2`, so the driver only ever
//! sees `db_tip_l2 + 1` onward. The very first sync of a genesis snapshot has no checkpoint yet, so
//! the caller supplies the genesis start point.
//!
//! ## ArbOS version across upgrades
//!
//! This runtime does not carry an ArbOS version. The version advances per block downstream:
//! The native payload builder derives the message-parse version from the parent header's encoded
//! ArbOS version, and the per-block start-block internal tx applies scheduled ArbOS state
//! upgrades (`upgrade_arbos_version`, arb_revm `internal_tx.rs`) when due. So a catch-up across
//! an upgrade boundary is wired, though not yet validated against a real mainnet upgrade crossing.
