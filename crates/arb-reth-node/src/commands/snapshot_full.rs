//! `arb-reth snapshot import-full`: turn a `reth-export --mode full-snapshot` stream into a reth
//! datadir that carries block history and per-block state history, not just head state.
//!
//! The stream holds a manifest, then blocks, then state history, then the state trie, all ending at
//! the same block. Sections are written in that order, which is also append-only order for reth's
//! static files. Invariants and their reasoning live in
//! `arb-kb/decisions/ADR-004-snapshot-conversion-invariants.md`; the checks below name the ones they
//! enforce.
//!
//! The completion manifest is written last and only on success, so an interrupted run leaves a
//! datadir the node refuses to boot rather than one that answers historical queries with silence.
